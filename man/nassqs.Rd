\arguments{
\item{...}{either a named list of parameters or a series of additional
parameters that include operations, e.g. \code{year__GE = 2010} for all
records in 2010 and later. See \code{details} for information on available
operators.}

\item{agg_level_desc}{Geographic level ("AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT", "COUNTY",

\item{domain_desc}{Domain, a characteristic of operations that produce a
particular commodity (e.g., "ECONOMIC CLASS", "AREA OPERATED", "NAICS
CLASSIFICATION", "SALES"). For chemical usage data, the domain describes
the type of chemical applied to the commodity. The domain_desc: = "TOTAL"
will have no further breakouts; i.e., the data value pertains completely
to the short_desc.}

\item{end_code}{= Week number that the data series ends.}

\item{freq_desc}{Time period type covered by the data ("ANNUAL", "SEASON",
"MONTHLY", "WEEKLY", "POINT IN TIME"). "MONTHLY" often covers more than one
month. "POINT IN TIME" is for a particular day.}

\item{group_desc}{Commodity group within a sector (e.g., under sector_desc =
"CROPS", the groups are "FIELD CROPS", "FRUIT & TREE NUTS", "HORTICULTURE",
and "VEGETABLES").}

\item{load_time}{Date and time of the data load, e.g. "2015-02-17 16:05:20".}

\item{location_desc}{Location code, e.g. 5-digit fips code for counties.}

\item{prodn_practice_desc}{Production practice, (e.g. "UNDER PROTECTION",
"OWNED, RIGHTS, LEASED", "ORGANIC, TRANSITIONING", "HIRED MANAGER").}

\item{reference_period_desc}{Reference period of the data (e.g. "JUN",
"MID SEP", "WEEK #32").}

\item{region_desc}{Region name (e.g. "TEXAS", "WA & OR", "WEST COAST",
"UMATILLA").}

\item{sector_desc}{Sector, the five high level, broad categories useful to
narrow down choices. ("ANIMALS & PRODUCTS", "CROPS", "DEMOGRAPHICS",
"ECONOMICS", or "ENVIRONMENTAL").}

\item{short_desc}{A concatenation of six columns: \code{commodity_desc},
\code{class_desc}, \code{prodn_practice_desc}, \code{util_practice_desc},
\code{statisticcat_desc}, and \code{unit_desc}.}

\item{source_desc}{Source of data ("CENSUS" or "SURVEY"). Census program
includes the Census of Ag as well as follow up projects. Survey program
includes national, state, and county surveys.}

\item{state_alpha}{2-character state abbreviation, e.g. "NM".}

\item{state_ansi}{State ANSI code.}

\item{state_fips_code}{State FIPS code.}

\item{state_name}{Full name of the state, e.g. "ALABAMA".}

\item{statisticcat_desc}{Statistical category of the data (e.g.,
"AREA HARVESTED", "PRICE RECEIVED", "INVENTORY", "SALES").}

\item{unit_desc}{The units of the data (e.g. "TONS / ACRE", "TREES",

"ONCE REFINED", "FEED", "ANIMAL FEED").}

\item{watershed_code}{Watershed code as 8-digit HUC (e.g. "13020100").}

\item{watershed_desc}{Watershed/HUC name (e.g. "UPPER COLORADO").}

\item{week_ending}{Date of ending week (e.g. "1975-11-22").}

\item{year}{Year of the data. Conditional values are possible by appending an
operation to the parameter, e.g. "year__GE = 2020" will return all records
with year >= 2020. See \code{details} for more on operations.}

\item{zip_5}{5-digit zip code.}

\item{as_numeric}{Whether to convert data to numeric format. Conversion will
replace missing notation such as "(D)" or "(Z)" with NA, but removes the
need to convert to numeric format after querying.}

\item{progress_bar}{Whether or not to display the progress bar.}

\item{format}{The format to return the query in. Only useful if as = "text".}

\item{as}{whether to return a data.frame, list, or text string. See

\description{
The primary function in the \code{rnassqs} package, \code{nassqs} makes a HTTP GET
request to the USDA-NASS Quick Stats API and returns the data parsed as a
data.frame, plain text, or list. Various other functions make use of \code{nassqs}
to make specific queries. For a data request the Quick Stats API returns
JSON that when parsed to a data.frame contains 39 columns and a varying
number of rows depending on the query. Unfortunately there is not a way to
restrict the number of columns.
}
\details{
\code{nassqs()} accepts all parameters that are accepted by the USDA-NASS Quick
Stats. These parameters are listed in \code{\link[=nassqs_params]{nassqs_params()}}, and are used to form
the data query.

Parameters can be modified by operations, which are appended to the parameter
name. For example, "year__GE = 2020" will fetch data in 2020 and after.
Operations can take the following form:
\itemize{
\item __LE: less than or equal (<=)
\item __LT: less than (<)
\item __GT: greater than (>)
\item __GE: = >=
\item __LIKE = like
\item __NOT_LIKE = not like
\item __NE = not equal
}
